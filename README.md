# Digital Forensics & Incident Response Lab

This repository contains the guide and resources for a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) lab. The lab teaches how to set up a forensic workstation, acquire evidence and perform analysis across disk, memory and network data.

## Overview

You will:

- Set up a forensic workstation using SIFT or Autopsy on a virtual machine and collect baseline tools (Sleuth Kit, Volatility, Wireshark).
- Acquire disk and memory images from a target system using write-blockers or forensic acquisition tools.
- Analyze file systems (NTFS/ext) for deleted files, artifacts and logs with Autopsy and Sleuth Kit.
- Perform memory analysis with Volatility to extract running processes, network connections, loaded modules and possible malware.
- Inspect network packet captures with Wireshark or Zeek to identify suspicious activity and reconstruct sessions.
- Build a timeline of events from file system and log timestamps.
- Document findings, indicators of compromise and remediation recommendations in an incident report.

All data in this lab is synthetic or publicly sourced. The guide is for educational use only and does not require access to classified data.
